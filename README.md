## K-Nearest Neighbours Classification for Animal Type Prediction

### Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) algorithm for classifying animal types based on a given dataset. The project involves a series of tasks including data analysis, preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation, aimed at demonstrating the effectiveness of KNN in classification problems.

### Data Analysis:
- Visualized the dataset to uncover patterns and relationships between features.
- Identified key attributes that influence classification.

### Data Preprocessing:
- Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data quality and robustness.
- Standardized and normalized features as necessary for improved model performance.

### Data Splitting:
- Divided the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate model performance effectively.

### K-Nearest Neighbours Implementation:
- Implemented the KNN algorithm using the scikit-learn library.
- Conducted hyperparameter tuning to select the optimal distance metric and value for K.

### Model Evaluation:
- Assessed classifier performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Utilized confusion matrices to further understand classification performance.

### Decision Boundary Visualization:
- Created visualizations to illustrate decision boundaries and the modelâ€™s classification regions.
